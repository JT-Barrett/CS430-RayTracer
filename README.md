# CS430-RayTracer

CS 430 Project 4: Raytraciing

This repository contains the project files for a ray tracer that incorporates the representation of reflection and a failed attempt at implementing refraction.

HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM:

Navigate to the directory with project files in console
Call "make"
Use the following command pattern to run: ./raytrace.exe width height input.json output.ppm
If you wish to make the image rectangular, make sure you update the camera to identical proportions. If you don't you will get a distorted image.

Sample input files and output files from the project spec and of my own creation are provided.
